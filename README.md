##How It Was Made:
###Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JS, Express and EJS
We broke down together what was needed to create the project such as the server-side bot choice, and assigned each other a role to work on. 
###UI(EJS) & CSS: John-Monk
###Computer Choice Generation: Kure-ru & GeorgiaaX
###Player Choice And Score Tracking: matthewmonolith & a-rud017 
###Refactoring Code: a-rud017

##Optimisations
The server code was in orginally in NODE, however it was refactored into Express for significant readability improvements.
HTML was switched to EJS view engine
Client-side JS refactored to improve readability and optimisation

##Lessons Learned:
Creating the logic and functional code first, then refactor to improve the project on several fronts.
